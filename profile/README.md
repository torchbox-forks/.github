# Torchbox Forks

`torchbox-forks` contains forks of repositories [@torchbox](https://github.com/torchbox) use in some of their applications, where it's become necessary to contribute fixes sooner than the upstream can provide.

As we primarily work with open-source applications, we use a lot of community-maintained packages to save us building everything from scratch. While this saves time on up-front development, the same isn't necessarily true for ongoing maintenance, especially as some packages become neglected or abandoned by their original developers over time.

Where possible, we contribute all worked work upstream. We do this because we want to contribute this work back to the community we're benefiting from; and because we'd prefer to use the official package to maintaining our own fork in parallel.

## Support & Guarantees

`torchbox-forks` projects exist solely for use by Torchbox. If they work for you, fantastic! However, once a forked project is no longer necessary, because the changes have been released upstream, or we no longer need the package, the repository may be removed without warning.
